The Future Value Application is a PHP-based web project designed to calculate the future value of an investment based on user input. It takes three key parameters—initial investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years—and uses them to compute the projected value of the investment over time. This application serves as a practical exercise in form handling, server-side validation, and dynamic content rendering using PHP. Users interact with a simple form on the index.php page, and upon submission, the data is processed and displayed on the display_results.php page. The project emphasizes clean user experience, accurate calculations, and robust error handling.

As part of the enhancement exercise, additional validation logic was implemented to improve the reliability and usability of the application. Specifically, the code was updated to ensure that the interest rate entered by the user does not exceed 15%. If an invalid rate is submitted, the application now displays a clear error message—“Interest rate must be less than or equal to 15”—and prompts the user to correct the input. This enhancement was added to the display_results.php file and tested thoroughly using both valid and invalid inputs. The validation logic complements existing checks for empty or non-numeric values, making the application more resilient and user-friendly.

The project was developed and tested within PhpStorm, using its built-in Run functionality to simulate user interactions. Testing included multiple scenarios: entering valid data to confirm accurate calculations, submitting blank or incorrect values to trigger error messages, and verifying that the new interest rate constraint behaves as expected. These enhancements not only reinforce best practices in PHP development but also demonstrate the importance of thoughtful validation in building reliable web applications. The final version is ready for submission and includes both the updated code and documentation of the testing process.
